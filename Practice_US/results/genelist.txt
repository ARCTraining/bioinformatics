statistical significance of having drawn a sample consisting of a specific number of  k successes out of n total draws from a population of size N containing  K successes. In a test for over-representation of successes in the sample, the hypergeometric p-value is calculated as the probability of randomly drawing {\displaystyle k} k or more successes from the population in {\displaystyle n} n total draws. In a test for under-representation, the p-value is the probability of randomly drawing {\displaystyle k} k or fewer successes.
